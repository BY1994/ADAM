EEG analysis pipeline:
- re-reference
- identify and interpolate bad channels -> save names of rejected channels

* Merge datasets beloning to the same sessions (only same-day blocks!)

- Read in data into EEG lab:
	* epoch (think about window!)
	* highpass filter (.1 or .01)
	* interpolate electrodes (make electrode_interpolation files)

- for ICA blink removal:
	highpass (preferably at 1 hz)
	remove mean of entire window
	best on continuous, but not necessary
	if epoched: prevent overlapping time windows


- Run ICA on continuous data with options 1 Hz highpass filter and interpolate electrodes (use electrode_interpolation files from main analysis pipeline)
- Apply that ICA to the epoched .1 Hz filtered data to remove blinks
- Identify bad components using ADJUST plugin
- Throw out bad components and calculate back data without those components
- Check data

* Merge datasets belonging to the same subjects (only if coming from different days)

- Mark eye-movements and other artifacts in trigger codes so these are not analyzed (optional)

- Analyze (classification or forward modeling), baseline correction and muscle rejection is done by script

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Highpass filter (.1) and epoch
2) Run ICA on continuous 1 Hz highpass filtered data, interpolate bad channels
3) Remove eye-blinks from .1 Hz highpass filtered and epoched data using ADJUST
4) Inspect components, iterate to remove only blink artifacts
5) Mark eye-movements from HEOG and VEOG in trigger codes so these are not analyzed
6) Run analysis (do baselining and muscle artefact removal during analysis, or throw out bad trials beforehand)
